# Super Movie Library - Bring those stuck in the past to the present!

Super movie library is an app intended to keep a digital log for the few left who still buy DVDs.

### Background 

My dad is getting up there in age and I believe he was the inspiration behind what they say about old dogs. He still buys DVDs even though we have access to 5+ streaming services. His memory isn't that great either so he often forgets what he has and this results in duplicate copies.

He can buy them all he wants, but why spend money on another copy when he has one? And how can he remember if he has one already? Alphabetize? Sure, but I'm a developer so why not build a web app to keep track of them? (Plus alphabetizing would require they be put back where they belong. And you know what they say about old dogs.)

## Features

This app uses the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) api to fetch data and presents that data to the user. Then the user can view info on popular movies, movies in theaters, top rated movies, or they can search.

To post reviews or store movies in their collection users have the option of signing up or continuing as a guest. If they choose to continue as a guest, changes made to the guest account may not be saved as anyone who chooses to continue as a guest may make their own changes. 

However they choose to continue, they may then write a review on any movie they choose by viewing the movie page or can add a movie to their collection.

Once viewing their collection, users can favorite any movie they wish. There is also a toggle switch to only display movies that are favorited. They can also add movies from any page elsewhere on the site and remove movies if they are viewing them in their collection.

User's can write reviews, but they can also see other's reviews on those movies. If the user who wrote a certain review is logged in, they can delete their own review.

There is also a dark mode toggle switch once users decide to log in or continue as a guest. This setting will be saved so once the user logs in again the page will either show light or dark mode, depending on which one the user chose last.

With this app, users can have an online record of their movie collection.
